AI-Driven Revenue Integrity & Predictive Financial Intelligence System for Hospitals
Project Overview

Hospitals generate revenue through consultations, procedures, diagnostics, pharmacy services, and insurance claims. However, financial leakage often occurs due to billing errors, under-coded procedures, claim denials, and delayed payments.

This project develops an AI-driven analytics system that transforms hospital claim data into financial insights, predictive risk detection, and decision-support tools.

The system combines data analytics, machine learning, and forecasting models to help hospitals monitor revenue performance and identify financial risks proactively.

Objectives

The system aims to:

Identify revenue leakage and financial inefficiencies

Predict insurance claim denial risk

Forecast future hospital revenue trends

Detect billing anomalies and unusual patterns

Provide data-driven insights for hospital management

System Architecture

The system follows a five-layer architecture:

1️⃣ Data Layer

Contains hospital claim-level financial and operational data.

Key data types:

Financial data (revenue, billing, payments)

Operational data (length of stay, documentation delay)

Insurance and procedure data

Time-based claim records

2️⃣ Data Processing & Feature Engineering

Transforms raw claim data into structured datasets by:

Cleaning missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Converting date fields

Creating financial performance metrics

Derived features include:

Revenue Leakage

Revenue Leakage Index

Accounts Receivable Days

Charge Capture Efficiency

Revenue at Risk

3️⃣ Analytics & Machine Learning Layer

This layer contains four analytical modules.

Revenue Leakage Analysis

Identifies financial gaps between expected and actual revenue.

Claim Denial Risk Prediction

Uses Logistic Regression to estimate the probability of claim denial.

Revenue Forecasting

Uses ARIMA time-series forecasting to predict future hospital revenue trends.

Billing Anomaly Detection

Uses Isolation Forest to detect unusual billing patterns and financial outliers.

4️⃣ Business Intelligence Layer

Transforms model outputs into business insights such as:

Revenue risk indicators

Department profitability

Denial risk distribution

Forecasted revenue trends

5️⃣ Presentation Layer

Insights will be delivered through an interactive Streamlit dashboard designed for hospital administrators and financial analysts.
